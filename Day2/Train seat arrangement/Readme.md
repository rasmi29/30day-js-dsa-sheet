# Train Seating Arrangement - JavaScript  

## 🚀 Problem Background  

Sherlock Holmes is faced with another perplexing mystery!  

A secret communication channel has been compromised, and a series of encrypted messages have been intercepted. Each message appears **exactly twice**, except for **one unique message - the Lone Survivor**.  

Sherlock needs your help to identify this message before it’s too late! However, there are some constraints:  

1. The solution **must be fast** (O(n) time complexity).  
2. You can only use **constant extra space** (O(1) space complexity) to keep the operation secret.  

Can you crack the case and uncover the **Lone Survivor**?

## 📝 Problem Statement  

Given a **non-empty array of integers** `nums`, where every element appears **exactly twice** except for **one unique element**, find and return the unique element.  

### 🔍 Conditions:  

✅ The solution must run in **O(n) time complexity**.  
✅ It must use only **O(1) extra space**.  

---

## 📥 Input Format  

- A **single array of integers** `nums` where:  
  - Every element appears exactly **twice** **except for one unique element**.  

---

## 📤 Output Format  

- A **single integer** representing the **unique element** in the array.  

---

## ✅ Constraints  

- `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`  
- `-10^9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9`  
- Every element except one appears **twice**.  

---

## 💡 Example  

### 🔹 Input  
```js
nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
```

### 🔹 Output  
```js
4
```

### 🔹 Explanation  
- `1` appears twice  
- `2` appears twice  
- `4` appears **only once**  

Thus, the output is `4`.
